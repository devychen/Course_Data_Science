Excuse me, do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.
So-so it's true?
I mean, do you really have the the Scar?
Wicked.
No, thanks, I'm all set.
Whoa!
They mean every flavour!
There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe.
George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
It's just a spell.
Besides, it's the cards you want.
Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.
I got about five-hundred myself.
Watch it!
Oh, that's rotten luck.
They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
I got about six of him.
Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
This is Scabbers by the way, pathetic isn't he?
Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow.
Want to see?
Ahem.
Sun
No.
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!
I'm Ron Weasley.
Whoa!
Wicked.
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
Harry, what is it?
Ahhh!
I know you!
You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Ahhh!
Look at that one, Harry!
Whew, made it.
Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?
That was bloody brilliant.
Turn it into rum.
Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before- Ah!
Mail's here!
Up!
Ow! Shut up,
Harry. Seeker?
But first years never make their house teams!
You must be the youngest Quidditch player in-
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.
Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great.
Best game there is!
And you'll be great too!
Whoa.
Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker too!
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.
Ahhh!
Before the staircase moves again.
It's Filch's cat!
That's it!
We're done for!
Alohomora?
Probably thinks this door's locked.
AHHHHH!
What do they think they're doing?
Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads!
Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
She needs to sort out her priorities.
Wingardium Leviosar!
You do it then if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.
It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaar.
She's a nightmare, honestly.
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.
Not by itself.
Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.
What?
I think the troll's left the dungeon.
Hey, pea brain!
Ew.
What?
Wingardium Leviosa!
Well, what it is Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.
Let's open it.
That's not just any broomstick, Harry!
It's a Nimbus two-thousand!
Yay!
Jinxing the broom?
What do we do?
Come on, Hermione!
Go!
Fluffy?
Queen to E5.
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.
Change of plans.
My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.
He's studying dragons there.
We've looked a hundred times.
I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Harry, wake up!
Come on Harry, wake up!
Happy Christmas, Harry.
Oh.
My mum made it.
It looks like you've got one too.
Yeah!
There they are.
What is it?
Well, let's see then, put it on.
Whoa!
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak.
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.
Why?
I only see me.
That's me!
Only, I'm head boy and I'm holding the Quidditch cup!
And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too!
I look good.
Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
This is light?
The what?
Immortal?
I know what it means!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
I know what that is!
But Hagrid, how did you get one?
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback!
My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.
It's bad.
Okay.
But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final.
Speak for yourself.
All right there Harry?
Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Trevor.
Trevor, sshh, go!
You shouldn't be here!
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that?
Brilliant, but scary.
It's for your own good, you know.
Sorry.
Eugh.
It's got horrible breath.
What?
Euuugh!
Yuck!
Eugh.
Ahhhhhhh!!
Wow.
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!
Hermione!
Now what are we gonna do?
Ahhhhh!!
Harry!
Harry! Ahhhh!
Help!
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Yeah.
Phew!
Lucky we didn't panic.
Alohomora!
Well, it was worth a try.
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty, like the handle.
Oh go on Harry!
If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can.
You're the youngest Seeker in a century!
This complicates things a bit.
Hurry up!
This is no graveyard.
It's a chessboard.
It's obvious, isn't it?
We've got to play our way across the room.
All right, Harry, you take the empty bishop's square.
Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle.
And as for me, I'll be a knight.
Well, white moves first.
And thenwe play.
You there, D-5!
Yes
Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard chess.
Castle to E-4!
Pawn to C-3!  
You understand right, Harry.
Once I make my move, the queen will take me.
Then you're free to check the king.
Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that stone or not?
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.
Not me.
Not Hermione.
You.
Knight to H-3.
Check All right.
You?
Hiya, Harry.
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on.
Get your trunk!
You'd better stand back.
Let's go!
Come on.
Come on, Harry! Hurry up!
I've got you Harry! Drive!
By the way, Harry, happy birthday!
Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
It's not much, but it's home.
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window!
Ginny.
She's been talking about you all summer.
Bit annoying really.
Morning, Dad.
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.
Dad loves Muggles.
Thinks they're fascinating.
He's always doing that.
But Harry's never travelled by Floo powder before, Mum. Diagon Alley.
Mum fancies him.
Whoaa!
I don't know.
The gateway's sealed itself for some reason.
Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!
The car Uh, right.
Okay.
We can't be far behind.
We must be getting close.
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Harry!
Hold on!
Take my hand!
Hold on!
Yeah.
Welcome home.
It's not working!
Ahhhhh!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Huh Ahhhhh!
Ahhahh!
My wand!
Look at my wand!
What's happening?
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Scabbers, you okay?
The car!
Dad's gonna kill me.
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
We'll go and get our stuff, then.
You're going to expel us, aren't you?
Huh Say it, I'm doomed.
Bloody bird's a menace!
Oh, no!
What do we do now?
Uh-oh.
I smell trouble.
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones!
How did you get those?
You'll pay for that one Malfoy!
Eat slugs!
It's disgusting.
Hear what?
Kill?
I don't like spiders.
What's that?
Are you mad?
Ahem.
Vera Verto!
Three guesses who.
Do you think it's true?
Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Let's think.
Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Of course!
You heard him!
You'll be next Mudbloods.
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Wicked!
Malfoy will tell us anything.
I'll stop it.
Of course.
Don't you see?
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Enlighten me.
Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?
Why?
Who?
Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Who cares?
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?
Oh, that's what you said to it!
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language?
Exactly!
Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.
How?
Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Ahem
Yeah.
Right.
How thick could you get?
Ugh!
Essence of Crabbe.
I think I'm gonna be sick!
Uh Harry?
Bloody hell!
Uh Bloody hell.
But where's Hermione?
Okay.
What are you doing uh, I mean What are you doing down here?
Uhh Ahem Stomachache.
S-scar.
That was close!
Look at your tail!
Have you spoken to Hermione?
Yuck!
But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
I mean, it'll just go right through you.
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
That'll be a cheerful visit!
Hello Hagrid.
Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
No!
Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.
Hermione!
But you heard McGonagall!
We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
That's Dad's boss!
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
Hagrid's right!
With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!
What?!
They're headed to the Dark Forest!
Why spiders?!
Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?!
Harry, I don't like this Harry, I don't like this at all!
Can we go back now?
Harry.
Harry!
Ahh Can we panic now?
Know any spells?
Where's Hermione when you need her?
Woah!
Glad we're out of there!
Ahhhhh!
Thanks for that.
The flying gear's jammed!
I'm trying!
Follow the spiders!
Follow the spiders!
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him!
I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?
What have we found out?
What's that?
But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is no one dead?
And Mrs. Norris?
I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
But how's a basilisk been getting around?
A dirty great snake, someone would have seen it.
Pipes?
It's using the plumbing!
Moaning Myrtle.
Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.
Ginny What about my sister?!
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!
You can't go now!
Is there anything you can do?
Say something, Harry!
Say something in Parseltongue!
Better you than us.
Ahhhhh!
Ugh!  Go on.
What's this?
Bloody hell.
Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long, or more!
Heart of a lion, this one.
Harry!
Harry!
I'm fine!
Um Ron Weasley.
Lockhart's memory charm backfired!
He hasn't got a clue who he is!
No.
What do I do now?
Okay!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thanks, sir!
Uhh
umm Wel-
Welcome back, Hermione.
