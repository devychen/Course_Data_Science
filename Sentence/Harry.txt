Yes, Aunt Petunia.
Yes, Uncle Vernon.
He's asleep!
Sorry about him.
He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.
Can you hear me?
It's just I've never talked to a snake before.
Do you
I mean do you talk to people often?
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there, do you miss your family?
I see.
That's me as well.
I never knew my parents, either.
Any time.
Ow!
I swear I don't know!
One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone!
It was like magic!
Hey, give it back!
It's mine!
Because there's no post on Sunday?
Get off!
Ahh!
They're my letters!
Let go of me!
Make a wish, Harry.
I-I am.
Thank you!
Excuse me, who are you?
Sorry, no.
Learned what?
I-I'm a what?
No, you've made a mistake.
I can't be a-a wizard.
I mean, I'm just Harry.
Just Harry.
Dear, Mr. Potter.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
You knew?
You know all along
and you never told me?
Blown up?
You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Muggle?
Okay.
All students must be equipped with one standard size two pewter cauldron, and may bring if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad.
Could we find all this in London?
Oh, nice to meet you.
Goodbye.
But why am I famous, Hagrid?
All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
What's in there, Hagrid?
I still need a wand.
Hello?
Hello?
Sorry, but whats curious?
And who owned that wand?
Wow.
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.
You know, Hagrid, I know you do.
Maybe if you wrote it down?
Voldemort?
Me?
Voldemort tried to kill me?
What happened toto You-Know-Who?
Platform nine-and-three-quarters?
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says Platform nine-and-three-quarters.
There's no such thing is there?  
Excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where I might find Platform nine-and-three-quarters?
Muggles?
Excuse me!
C-could you tell me how to- Not at all.
I'm Harry.
Harry Potter.
The what?
Oh.
We'll take the lot!
Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?
I got Dumbledore!
Hey, he's gone!
A little.
Yeah!
Hey, Hagrid.
I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.
Ahh!
Nothing nothing, I'm fine.
Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin Anything but Slytherin.
Wow.
Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
What's he teach?
I think she fancies you.
We got lost.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know, sir.
What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Can I borrow this?
Thanks.
Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.
Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken.
The vault in question, number seven-hundred-and-thirteen, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.
That's odd.
That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
Up!
Wow.
Neville!
Give it here, Malfoy.
Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom.
A century!
According to McGonagall.
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?
I didn't know.
Who doesn't?
What's happening?
Let's go this way.
Does anyone feel like we shouldn't be here?
Let's go.
Run!
Quick!
Let's hide through that door!
It's locked!
And for good reason.
AHHHHH!
Guarding something?
I think so.
What are those?
What is that?
I like this ball.
What do I do with it?
Whoa.
I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
How could a troll get in?
Hermione!
She doesn't know!
It's going into the girls' bathroom!
Hermione, move!
Whoa!!
Whoa, whoa!  
Whoa whoa whoa!
Do something!
Anything!
Hurry up.
I don't think so.
Just knocked out.
Ew. Troll bogies.
Well, what it is I'm not hungry.
That explains the blood.
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that three headed dog.
But, he got himself bitten.
That's why he's limping.
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults.
He said it was Hogwarts business, very secret.
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.
But I-I never get mail.
It's a broomstick!
But who..?
A little.
What happened?
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Who knows?
Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Yes?
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
Exactly.
Nicholas Flamel?
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Knight to E5.
Happy Christmas, Ron.
What are you wearing?
I-I've got presents?
Your father left this in my possession before he died.
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.
It's some kind of cloak.
My body's gone!
I'm invisible?
There was no name.
It just said use it well.
Famous Fire EatersFifteenth-Century FiendsFlamelNicholas Flamelwhere are you?
Mum?
Dad?
Ron!
You've really got to see this!
Ron!
You've got to see this!
Ron!
Come on!
Get out of bed!
There's something you've got to see.
Now, come on!
Come on.
Come on.
Come look, it's my parents!
Look in properly.
Go on.
Stand there.
You see them, don't you?
That's my dad.
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.
So, then it shows us what we want?
Whatever we want?
The what?
Sshhh!
Hagrid!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid, we know he's after the stone.
We just don't know why.
What?
Wait a minute.
One of the teachers?
Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
Norbert?
Malfoy.
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.
I don't understand.
Is that bad?
Fifty?!
Hagrid, what's that?
If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
What is it, Fang?
But what was that thing you saved me from?
But who would choose such a life?
Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn that was drinking its bloodthat was Voldemort?
The Philosopher's Stone.
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.
Don't you see?
We had it wrong!
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the Stone for Voldemort.
With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again.
He'll he'll come back.
I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.
My scar.
It keeps burning.
Not like this.
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.
Oh.
Of course.
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one?
I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket?
Why didn't I see it before?
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?
This stranger though, you and he must have talked?
Did he seem interested in Fluffy?
We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
He's gone?
But this is important!
This is about the Philosopher's Stone.
Someone's going to try and steal it.
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
We go down the trapdoor, tonight.
No Neville, listen.
We were- Let's go.
Sorry.
Wait a minute.
He's snoring.
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.
We have to move its paw.
Come on!
Okay.
Push.
I'll go first.
Don't follow until I give you a sign.
If something bad happens, get yourselves out.
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?
Jump!!
Wow!
Oh, ah!
Hermione!
Hermione, where are you?
Yeah,
yeah,
I'm fine.
Apparently not.
What?
Ron, you okay?
Okay.
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
I don't know.
Sounds like wings.
They're not birds.
They're keys.
And I bet one of them fits that door.
I don't know.
Strange.
There!
I see it!
The one with the broken wing!
It's too simple.
Catch the key!
Where are we?
A graveyard?
There's the door.
Wait a minute.
No, Ron, no!
He's going to sacrifice himself.
Ron!
No!
Don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.
Checkmate Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery, send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.
I have to go on.
Not as good as you.
Ow!
You? N-no, it can't be!
Snape, h-he w-was the-
But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.
Snape was trying to save me?
Th-then you let the troll in!
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.
Voldemort.
Never!
You liar!
Admirers?
Ron was here?
Is he all right?
What about Hermione?
But what happened to the Stone?
But then Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
How is it I got the stone, sir?
One minute I was staring in the mirror and-
Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that is, that Voldemort can never come back?
What is it?
All right there, Ron?
All right.
Hermione?
One minute.
Thanks, Hagrid.
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts.
You know that.
I'm not going home, not really.
I can't let you out, Hedwig.
I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school.
Besides, if Uncle Vernon- Now you've done it.
But she's bored.
If I could only let her out for an hour or two.
But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends.
Not one.
All summer.
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
Who are you?
Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
Why don't you sit down?
Dobby, sshh!!
I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to offend you or anything.
You can't have met many decent wizards then.
Stop, Dobby!
Dobby, shh!!
Dobby, please stop!
Dobby, stop!
Please be quiet.
Are you all right?
Your family?
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?
Okay, I understand.
You can't say.
Dobby?
Dobby, put the lamp down.
Give me the lamp!
Dobby, stop!
Get in there and keep quiet!
I was just Sorry.
Yes sir.
See why I've got to go back?!
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.
It's the only place I've got friends.
Well I expect they've been Hang on, how did you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
Give me those, now.
Dobby, get back here.
Dobby, please, no.  
I can't.
Hogwarts is my home.
Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?
Ahh!
Ahh!
Let go of me!
I think it's brilliant.
Hello.
W-what did I do?
Raids?
Oh, sorry sir.
I'm Harry sir, Harry Potter.
Oh.
Um Floo powder?
Diagonally.
Ahh!
Ah!
I'm fine, thank you.
I-I was just No.
Please.
Hagrid!
I was lost!
Hang on, what were you doing down there, then?
Oh it's great to see you too.
I definitely need to remember that one.
Thank you.
Bye.
Voldemort killed my parents.
He was nothing more than a murderer.
Let's go.
Ahhhh!
Sorry.
Lost-
lost control of the trolley.
Why can't we get through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock.
We've missed it!
Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Do you hear that?
Hold on Wha-aahhhhh!
I'm trying.
Your hand's all sweaty.
I think we found the train.
Up!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Ron!
Mind that tree!
Ahhhhh!
Be thankful it's not your neck.
I don't know.
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Ahhhhh!
Come on!
Go!
Fast!
See you, Hedwig.
So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.
You're doomed.
Oh, hi, Colin.
Nice to meet you.
Stop!
Stop!
Hold still!
Malfoy?
No, Colin!
Get out of the way!
Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do.
Ah!
Oh, okay.
Malfoy.
He called Hermione um, well, I don't- I dont know exactly what it means.
What's a Mudblood?
That's horrible!
Not really.
What?
That voice.
Didn't you hear it?
Spooky.
Did you hear it?
That voice.
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just-
It's moving..
I think it's going to kill.
Strange.
I've never seen spiders act like that.
Oh no.
It's Filch's cat.
It's Mrs. Norris.
No.
No.
It's not true, sir, I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.
When I said I wasn't hungry.
We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Strange?
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.
The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Well, how long will it take to make?
A month?
But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
Wood!
Look out!
Thank you.
No, I think my I think my arm's broken.
No, not you.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Dobby?
It was you You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Your Bludger?
You made that Bludger chase after me?
You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
Repeat itself?
You mean this has happened before?
Dobby, stop it!
Stop it!
Stop, Dobby!
Tell me, Dobby.
When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?
No, Dobby.
Tell me.
Who is it?
Thank you, sir.
You wish.
Rictusempra!
Sya hassa she.
Sya hasi heth.
Sya hasi heth.
I'm a what?
I know.
I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
Uh, once!
But, so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.
What's bad?
If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin- You were there!
You heard me!
I spoke a different language?
But I didn't realise I-
how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
But I'm not.
I can't be.
I'll see you back in the common room.
No!
Mr. Filch!
Y-you-you don't understand!
Professor I swear I didn't!
Professor Dumbledore?
I
I-I was - I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
You're wrong.
Professor!
Sir, your bird there was nothing I could do!
He-
he just caught fire!
You don't think it was me, Professor?
No sir, nothing.
Crabbe and Goyle.
Ron, maybe I should do it?
Wingardium Leviosa.
Here they come.
Come on.
Let's get em.
Eughhh!
Ron!
We still sound like ourselves.
You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Excellent.
Hermione, are you okay?
Come on.
I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
I'm Ah Um Reading.
Uh huh.
You're wrong!
Harry Potter?
But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
It's his stomachache.
Calm down.
Hair!
Hermione, come out!
We've got loads to tell you!
Hermione?
Are you okay?
She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls.
What's this?
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Why would I throw something at you?
But, who threw it at you anyway?
Tom Marvolo Riddle.
My name is Harry Potter.
Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
Can you tell me?
Excuse me.
Could you tell me what's going on here?
Are you Tom Riddle?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Dumbledore?
Hagrid!
Hagrid!
Wow!
It was Hagrid.
Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years go.
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?
No!
What's that you've got, Hagrid?
And they found it.
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
No.
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.
I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
What's that for?
Hagrid, are you okay?
Did you hear about Hermione?
Look, we have to ask you something.
Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Look!
Well, come on.
Come on, Fang!
Come on!
You heard what Hagrid said.
Follow the spiders.
Shush!
Come on!
Don't panic.
We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you?
Y-y-you're
Aragog aren't you?
He's in trouble.
Up at the school, there have been attacks.
They think it's Hagrid.
They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before.
Then you're not the monster.
Shush.
But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
But have you seen it?
What?
Well, thank you.
We'll just go.
One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Let's go!
Arania exumai!
Go!
Woah! Arania exumai!
Don't mention it.
Get us out of here.
Now!
Come on!
Come on!
Move faster!
Ahhh!
Go on!
Go!
Get us in the air.
Come on!
Pull!
We know one thing.
Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
He was innocent.
Wish you were here Hermione.
We need you now, more than ever.
Ron, this is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
Come on!
Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
Spiders flee before it.
Ron, this is it!
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake!
Because no one did look it in the eye.
Not directly, at least.
Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost, he can't die again.
And Hermione had the mirror.
I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along.
The water.
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
Spiders flee before it.
It all fits!
Hermione's answered that too.
Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago?
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?
Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.
At least we can tell him what we know.
Professor, we have some information for you!
Are you going somewhere?
You're running away?
After all that stuff you did in your books?
You wrote them!
You're a fraud!
You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Don't even think about it.
To ask you how you died.
Who was it, Myrtle?
Just like that?
How?
This is it.
This is it, Ron.
I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Hesha hassah.
Oh yes there is!
You first.
All right.
Let's go.
Uh thanks, Myrtle.
Ahhhh!
Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
This way.
It's a snakeskin.
Ron! Ron, are you okay?
You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through!
I'll go on and find Ginny!
Hesha hassah.
Ginny Ginny!
Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up.
Wake up!
Please, wake up!
Tom.
Tom Riddle!
What do you mean, she won't wake?
She's not?
Are you a ghost?
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up!
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.
Give me my wand, Tom.
Listen, we've got to go!
We've got to save her!
No.
She couldn't.
She wouldn't!
But why?
But, why did you want to meet me?
Hagrid's my friend!
And you framed him, didn't you?
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Well, you haven't finished it this time.
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.
You!
You're the Heir of Slytherin.
You're Voldemort.
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
He'll never be gone!
Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!
Fawkes?
Ginny.
Ginny.
Don't worry.
Ginny, you need to get yourself out.
Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron.
You were brilliant, Fawkes.
I just wasn't quick enough Of course!
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Thanks!
It's alright, Ginny.
It's over.
It's just a memory.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's just You see, sir, I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
So the Sorting Hat was right!
I should be in Slytherin.
Because I asked it to.
Godric Gryffindor.
Dobby!
So this is your master!
The family you serve is the Malfoys.
Don't worry.
I will be.
Sir, I wonder if I could have that?
Mr. Malfoy!
Mr. Malfoy!
I have something of yours.
Oh I think you do, sir.
I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.
Open it.
Just promise me something.
Never try to save me life again.
Well, we had loads of help from you.
We couldn't have done it without you.
Well there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
