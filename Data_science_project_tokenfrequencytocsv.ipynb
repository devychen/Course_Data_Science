it's just i've never talked to a snake before. do you i mean do you talk to people often? you're from burma, aren't you? was it nice there, do you miss your family? i see. that's me as well. i never knew my parents, either. any time. ow! i swear i don't know! one minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! it was like magic! hey, give it back! it's mine! because there's no post on sunday? get off! ahh! they're my letters! let go of me! make a wish, harry. i-i am. thank you! excuse me, who are you? sorry, no. learned what? i-i'm a what? no, you've made a mistake. i can't be a-a wizard. i mean, i'm just harry. just harry. dear, mr. potter. we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts' school of witchcraft and wizardry. you knew? you know all along and you never told me? blown up? you told me my parents died in a car crash! muggle? okay. all students must be equipped with one standard size two pewter cauldron, and may bring if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad. could we find all this in london? oh, nice to meet you. goodbye. but why am i famous, hagrid? all those people back there, how is it they know who i am? but, hagrid, how am i to pay for all this? i haven't any money. uh, hagrid, what exactly are these things? what's in there, hagrid? i still need a wand. hello? hello? sorry, but whats curious? and who owned that wand? wow. he killed my parents, didn't he? the one who gave me this. you know, hagrid, i know you do. maybe if you wrote it down? voldemort? me? voldemort tried to kill me? what happened toto you-know-who? platform nine-and-three-quarters? but, hagrid, there must be a mistake. this says platform nine-and-three-quarters. there's no such thing is there?  excuse me, excuse me. excuse me, sir. can you tell me where i might find platform nine-and-three-quarters? muggles? excuse me! c-could you tell me how to- not at all. i'm harry. harry potter. the what? oh. we'll take the lot! bertie bott's every flavour beans? these aren't real chocolate frogs, are they? i got dumbledore! hey, he's gone! a little. yeah! hey, hagrid. i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks. ahh! nothing nothing, i'm fine. not slytherin. not slytherin. not slytherin anything but slytherin. wow. say, percy, who's that teacher talking to professor quirrell? what's he teach? i think she fancies you. we got lost. i don't know, sir. i don't know, sir. what's seamus trying to do to that glass of water? can i borrow this? thanks. hey, ron, somebody broke into gringotts, listen. believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. the vault in question, number seven-hundred-and-thirteen, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. that's odd. that's the vault hagrid and i went to. up! wow. neville! give it here, malfoy. give it here, malfoy, or i'll knock you off your broom. a century! according to mcgonagall. but i've never even played quidditch. what if i make a fool of myself? i didn't know. who doesn't? what's happening? let's go this way. does anyone feel like we shouldn't be here? let's go. run! quick! let's hide through that door! it's locked! and for good reason. ahhhhh! guarding something? i think so. what are those? what is that? i like this ball. what do i do with it? whoa. i think we're going to need another feather over here, professor. i think she heard you. where's hermione? how could a troll get in? hermione! she doesn't know! it's going into the girls' bathroom! hermione, move! whoa ! whoa, whoa!  whoa whoa whoa! do something! anything! hurry up. i don't think so. just knocked out. ew. troll bogies. well, what it is i'm not hungry. that explains the blood. listen, last night, i'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that three headed dog. but, he got himself bitten. that's why he's limping. the day i was at gringotts, hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. he said it was hogwarts business, very secret. that's what the dog's guarding. that's what snape wants. but i-i never get mail. it's a broomstick! but who ? a little. what happened? yes! whoa! yes! whoa! whoa! who knows? why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on halloween? yes? but hagrid, whatever fluffy's guarding, snape's trying to steal it. exactly. nicholas flamel? nicholas flamel. who's nicholas flamel? knight to e5. happy christmas, ron. what are you wearing? i-i've got presents? your father left this in my possession before he died. it is time it was returned to you. use it well. it's some kind of cloak. my body's gone! i'm invisible? there was no name. it just said use it well. famous fire eatersfifteenth-century fiendsflamelnicholas flamelwhere are you? mum? dad? ron! you've really got to see this! ron! you've got to see this! ron! come on! get out of bed! there's something you've got to see. now, come on! come on. come on. come look, it's my parents! look in properly. go on. stand there. you see them, don't you? that's my dad. how can it? both my parents are dead. so, then it shows us what we want? whatever we want? the what? sshhh! hagrid! we know about the philosopher's stone! we think snape's trying to steal it. hagrid, we know he's after the stone. we just don't know why. what? wait a minute. one of the teachers? uh, hagrid, what exactly is that? norbert? malfoy. hagrid always wanted a dragon. he told me so the first time i met him. i don't understand. is that bad? fifty ! hagrid, what's that? if i didn't know better, draco, i'd say you were scared. what is it, fang? but what was that thing you saved me from? but who would choose such a life? do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn that was drinking its bloodthat was voldemort? the philosopher's stone. but he's weak. he's living off the unicorns. don't you see? we had it wrong! snape doesn't want the stone for himself. he wants the stone for voldemort. with the elixir of life, voldemort will be strong again. he'll he'll come back. i think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight. my scar. it keeps burning. not like this. i think it's a warning. it means danger's coming. oh. of course. don't you think it's a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? i mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? why didn't i see it before? hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? what did he look like? this stranger though, you and he must have talked? did he seem interested in fluffy? we have to see professor dumbledore, immediately! he's gone? but this is important! this is about the philosopher's stone. someone's going to try and steal it. that was no stranger hagrid met in the village. it was snape, which means he knows how to get past fluffy. we go down the trapdoor, tonight. no neville, listen. we were- let's go. sorry. wait a minute. he's snoring. snape's already been here. he's put a spell on the harp. we have to move its paw. come on! okay. push. i'll go first. don't follow until i give you a sign. if something bad happens, get yourselves out. does it seem a bit quiet to you? jump ! wow! oh, ah! hermione! hermione, where are you? yeah, yeah, i'm fine. apparently not. what? ron, you okay? okay. lucky hermione pays attention in herbology. i don't know. sounds like wings. they're not birds. they're keys. and i bet one of them fits that door. i don't know. strange. there! i see it! the one with the broken wing! it's too simple. catch the key! where are we? a graveyard? there's the door. wait a minute. no, ron, no! he's going to sacrifice himself. ron! no! don't move! don't forget, we're still playing. checkmate take care of ron. then go to the owlery, send a message to dumbledore. ron's right. i have to go on. not as good as you. ow! you? n-no, it can't be! snape, h-he w-was the- but that day, during the quidditch match, snape tried to kill me. snape was trying to save me? th-then you let the troll in! i'm shaking hands with dumbledore. i've won the house cup. voldemort. never! you liar! admirers? ron was here? is he all right? what about hermione? but what happened to the stone? but then flamel, he'll die, won't he? how is it i got the stone, sir? one minute i was staring in the mirror and- does that mean, with the stone gone, that is, that voldemort can never come back? what is it? all right there, ron? all right. hermione? one minute. thanks, hagrid. but hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from hogwarts. you know that. i'm not going home, not really.\n"

i checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading. of course! here it is! nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the philosopher's stone! honestly, dont you two read? the philosopher's stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. it will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal. it means you never die. the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicholas flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his six-hundred-and-sixty-fifth birthday! that's what fluffy's guarding on the third floor. that's what's under the trapdoor the philosopher's stone! we know about the philosopher's stone! of course! there are other things defending the stone, aren't there? spells, enchantments! is that a dragon? well, that's good, isn't it? he'll be with his own kind. harry! you mean you-know-who's out there right now, in the forest? hang on a minute. we're forgetting one thing. who's the one wizard voldemort always feared? dumbledore. as long as dumbledore's around, harry, you're safe. as long as dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. i'd always heard hogwarts end of year exams were frightful, but i found they're rather enjoyable. it's happened before. what is it? and with dumbledore gone- uh, uh, w-w-we were just- now what do we do? neville, i'm really really sorry about this. petrificus totalus. sorry. ow, you stood on my foot! alohomora. the harp. it's stopped playing. stop moving, both of you. this is devil's snare. you have to relax. if you don't, it will only kill you faster. just relax! do what i say! trust me! are you okay? he's not relaxing, is he? we've gotta do something! eugh, i remember reading something in herbology. um, devil's snare, devil's snare. it's deadly fun, but will sulk in the sun. that's it! devil's snare hates sunlight! lumus solem. what is that? curious. i've never seen birds like these. what's this all about? eugh! what are we going to do? there must be a thousand keys up there. what's wrong, harry? i don't like this. i don't like this at all. now what do we do? what happens now? ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you? what is it? no you can't! there must be another way! you'll be okay, harry. you're a great wizard. you really are. heh, me? books and cleverness. there are more important things. friendship and bravery. and harry, just be careful. never better. we're tied with slytherin! come on, harry. feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?\n"

what do we do? come on, hermione! go! fluffy? queen to e5. that's wizard's chess. i see you've packed. change of plans. my parents decided to go to romania to visit my brother charlie. he's studying dragons there. we've looked a hundred times. i think we've had a bad influence on her. harry, wake up! come on harry, wake up! happy christmas, harry. oh. my mum made it. it looks like you've got one too. yeah! there they are. what is it? well, let's see then, put it on. whoa! i know what that is. that's an invisibility cloak. they're really rare. i wonder who gave it to you. why? i only see me. that's me! only, i'm head boy and i'm holding the quidditch cup! and bloody hell, i'm quidditch captain too! i look good. harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

and to think, i've been worrying about my potions final. speak for yourself. all right there harry? perhaps you should see the nurse. trevor. trevor, sshh, go! you shouldn't be here! you're a little scary sometimes, you know that?
