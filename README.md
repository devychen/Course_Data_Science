**Title:**
**The Relations Between Personality and Language Use**

**Keywords** 
LIWC, Personality, Literacy Text Analysis

**Research Question** <br>
Do language variables of the LIWC refect personality factors as in previous LIWC studies?

**Hypotheses** <br>
Yes. More specifically (based on findings from previous studies):
1. Sentence-level: <br> Extroverted people tend to use more compound sentences (CS) and compound complex sentences (CCS) while introverted people use more simple sentence (SS).
2. Word-level:
   - Neuroticism is correlated with immediacy.
   - Extraversion is correlated with distinctions.
   - Openness is correlated with immediacy and the social past.
   - Agreeableness is related to immediacy.
   - conscientiousness is related to distinctions.

**Dataset** <br>
- Corpus: Corpus built on Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*.
- With references from literetures on personalities of the characters, we will analyse the features to see if the results align with their personality and if the hypotheses are true.
- The number of charcaters will be limited to 5 at most. 

**Analysis** <br>
- This mini project is instuitively inspired by the previous work of Pennebaker and King (1999).
- We will use LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) as a measure of personality by analysing the lines of selected characters.
- For personality, there are many classification methods, we will use the Big Five personality dimensions (Neuroticism/Stability, Extroversion, Openness, Agressableness, Conscientiousness, Openness) as it is widely applied in previous studies.

- A factor analysis of the 72 English LIWC variables provided four main factors: 
1. Immediacy: first-persona singular pronouns, articles, long words, present tense, discrepancies.
2. Distinctions: exclusiceness, tentativeness, negations, inclusive words.
3. Social past: past tense, positive emotion words, social words.
4. Rationalisation: insight, negative emotion words, causation words.
In sum, we intend to explore the following factors and the according correlation, to see if it aligns with the previous findings.
1. Immediacy: first-person singular, articles, words of ≥ 6 letters, present tense, discrepencies.
2. Making distinctions: Exclusive, tentativity, negations, inclusive.
3. The social past: past tense, social, positive emotion.
4. Rationalisation: insight, causation, negative emotion.

**Additional Notes** <br>
The project might be simplified a bit in practice if the corpus or workload is relatively too intense.
